# Reasons

Using this repository to hold files for practicing stuff   

-------------

Mainly, I want to learn C and also functional programming, partially because of the [infamous Spolsky blog post on Java Schools](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html). 

I also need to learn C for CSCI4061, the operating systems course at the U.

To learn C, I am slowly making my way through the C Programming Language, Second Edition by Brian Kernigan and Dennis Ritchie (The creator of C). 

We learned a little Clojure in CSCI2041, so I'll probably do some more with Clojure.
