# Reasons

Using this repository to hold files for practicing stuff   


-------------

Mainly, I want to learn C and also functional programming, partially because of the [infamous Spolsky blog post on Java Schools](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html). 

To learn C, I am slowly making my way through the C Programming Language, Second Edition by Brian Kernigan and Dennis Ritchie (The creator of C). Since the most popular implementation of Python is written in C, it would be good to learn more about the language. Also, I have read that the Arduino interface is basically C, so I can introduce simple robots to my daughter when she is old enough.

To learn functional programming, I am going through the Racket guides for now, and then maybe do some of the Project Euler stuff, but I probably will not. I am hoping that doing functional programming will help make me a better javascript developer. 

Overall, I think it will make me a better programmer. Since I am trying to get better at SQL and NoSQL (basically MongoDB), I may add folders for those into the repo.

After reading [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html), I may also have to add Go or Clojure, but that is after (if I ever understand) pointers and functional programming.
